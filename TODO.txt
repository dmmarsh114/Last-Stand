FEEDBACK

leveling up damage doesn't feel significant
	health bars for enemies? If you've hit them?
	damage numbers?

BUG: ball moves when you move in the opposite direction?

add new weapon type -> shooting shit is fun

assets look blurry
	scale assets down? 

player snaps to looking to the right when no input
